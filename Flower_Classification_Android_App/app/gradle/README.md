# Flower Classification Android App 

This app predicts the type of flower based on the values of Sepal length,Sepal width,Petal length and Petal width input by the user. It uses the popular Iris dataset for training a machine learning model for predicting the type of flower(Iris-setosa,Iris-Versicolor,Iris-Virginica). For integrating it in android we need a .tflite model, So we convert our ml model into tflite which is then used for deploying the model on Android.Then we create an android app using Android Studio and deploy the model in it.
